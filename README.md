A "historical" calendar renderer I wrote to allow for the display and inspection of my game-related (playing, modding, et cetera) history since 2010.

Drawn with handwritten FFP OpenGL (via lwjgl), embedded into a JavaFX GUI via DriftFX. Built with data derived from screenshot and other records on my local PC.

Allows for the examination of any point in time, as well as filtering based on various criteria, and export into a video timelapse.


This would not have been possible without the libraries I used, most notably lwjgl, DriftFX, and JavaFX.
